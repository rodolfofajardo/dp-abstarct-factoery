# Abstract Factory Design Pattern
A factory producer is used to create factories
(ShapeFactory and RoundShapeFactory)
which are subclasses of an abstract factory.

These factories are used to create objects
which in turn are implementations of an
interface (Shape), each dependant of the type
of factory (Square and Rectangle from
ShapeFactory and RoundSquare and 
RoundRectangle from RoundShapeFactory) in turn.
